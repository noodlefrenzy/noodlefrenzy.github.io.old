I work at Microsoft on a team that mostly develops open-source software in collaboration with startups or lab teams in enterprise organizations. Most of our team checks code directly into GitHub, and we maintain a fairly active presence online - blogging, tweeting, etc. We also give talks at conferences (some more than others), and we try and make sure problems and issues that people are having with Microsoft products (in particular Azure) get communicated (sometimes aggressively) back to the teams responsible.\r\n\r\n## My GitHub Repos\r\n\r\n* [node-amqp10](https://github.com/noodlefrenzy/node-amqp10): An AMQP 1.0 client implementation entirely in Node - no native code dependencies.\r\n* [node-sbus](https://github.com/noodlefrenzy/node-sbus) and [node-sbus-amqp10](https://github.com/noodlefrenzy/node-sbus-amqp10): `node-sbus` provides easy connection to Azure Event Hubs using any AMQP 1.0 client, tracking partition offsets in Azure. `node-sbus-amqp10` uses my `node-amqp10` as the implementation of the AMQP dependency (and is the one you should actively use in your project).\r\n\r\n## Other Information\r\n\r\n* [My Blog](http://www.mikelanzetta.com)\r\n* [My Twitter](https://www.twitter.com/noodlefrenzy)\r\n","google":"UA-54597100-2","note":"Don't delete this file!
